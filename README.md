SPark - prototype
=================

This is a repository for developing SPark-group's prototype for SCI-project course.

Idea
----
The main idea of the prototype is to visualize data collected from electric
vehicles. The data is just mock-up data and will most likely be modified from
HSL's bus locations available from [HSL's APIs](http://dev.hsl.fi).
